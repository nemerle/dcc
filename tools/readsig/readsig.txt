1 What is ReadSig?
------------------

ReadSig is a quick and dirty program to read signatures from a DCC
signature file. It was originally written as an integrity checker for
signature files, but can now be used to see what's in a signature
file, and which functions have duplicate signatures.

2 How do I use ReadSig?
-----------------------

Just type
readsig <sigfilename>

or

readsig -a <sigfilename>


For example:
readsig -a dcct2p.sig

Either way, you get a list of duplicate signatures, i.e. functions
whose first 23 bytes, after wildcarding and chopping, (see section 3
for details), that have the same signature.

With the -a switch, you also (before the above) get a list of all
symbolic names in the signature file, and the signatures themselves
in hex. This could be a dozen or more pages for large signature
files.

Currently, signatures are 23 bytes long, and the symbolic names are
truncated to 15 characters.


3 What are duplicate signatures?
--------------------------------

Duplicate signatures arise for 3 reasons. 1: length of the signature.
2: wildcards. 3: chopping of the signature.

1: Because signatures are only 23 bytes long, there is a chance that
two distinct signatures (first part of the binary image of a
function) are identical in the first 23 bytes, but diverge later.

2: Because part of the binary image of a function depends on where it
is loaded, parts of the signature are replaced with wildcards. It is
possible that two functions are distinct only in places that are
replaced by the wildcard byte (F4).

3: Signatures are "chopped" (cut short, and the remainder filled with
binary zeroes) after an unconditional branch or subroutine return.
This is to cope with functions shorter than the 23 byte size of
signatures, so unrelated functions are not included at the end of a
signature. (This would cause dcc to fail to recognise these short
signatures if some other function happened to be loaded at the end).

The effect of duplicate signatures is that only one of the functions
that has the same signature will be recognised. For example, suppose
that sin, cos, and tan were just one wildcarded instruction followed
by a jump to the same piece of code. Then all three would have the
same signature, and calls to sin, cos, or tan would all be reported
by dcc as just one of these, e.g. tan. If you suspect that this is
happening, then at least ReadSig can alert you to this problem.

In general, the number of duplicate signatures that would actually be
used in dcc is small, but it is possible that the above problem will
occur.



4 How can I make sense of the signatures?
-----------------------------------------

If you're one of those unfortunate individuals that can't decode hex
instructions in your head, you can always use DispSig to copy it to a
binary file, since you now know the name of the function. Then you
can use debug or some other debugger to disassemble the binary file.
Generally, most entries in signature files will be executable code,
so it should disassemble readily.

Be aware that signatures are wildcarded, so don't pay any attention
to the destination of jmp or call instructions (three or 5 byte
jumps, anyway; 2 byte jumps are not wildcarded), and 16 bit immediate
values. The latter will always be F4F4 (two wildcard bytes),
regardless of what they were in the original function.
